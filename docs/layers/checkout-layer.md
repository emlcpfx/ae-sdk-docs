# Checkout Layer

### Why is checkout_layer_pixels returning data == NULL for a layer parameter in SmartRender?

In GPU mode (CUDA, Metal, OpenCL), the SDK documentation states that you must assume the data pointer is NULL in PF_EffectWorld. The pixel data lives on the GPU, not in CPU memory. This is expected behavior when GPU rendering is active.

### How do you check out a frame with prior effects applied (not the raw layer)?

Use checkout_layer_pixels (from PF_SmartRenderCallbacks in SmartRender) instead of PF_CHECKOUT_PARAM. PF_CHECKOUT_PARAM always returns the layer before all effects were applied. checkout_layer_pixels returns the frame with all prior effects applied. You must first checkout the layer in PreRender, then checkout_layer_pixels in SmartRender.

### Is checking out the current layer with prior effects applied possible in Premiere?

In AE, you can use checkout_layer_pixels in SmartRender to get the layer with prior effects applied. However, this does not work in Premiere. In Premiere, there is no straightforward way to check out the current layer with prior effects applied - PF_CHECKOUT_PARAM always returns the pre-effects layer. A potential hacky workaround might involve calling Premiere's JS scripting API to render, but this is not a clean solution.

### How do you generate unique checkout IDs for checkout_layer/checkout_layer_pixels in SmartFX with multiple layers and instances?

This is a known challenge when dealing with multiple layers, multiple instances, and nested loops in SmartFX PreRender/SmartRender. The checkout ID must be unique across all checkouts. No definitive solution was provided in the discussion, but the issue typically arises with many cloned plugin instances resulting in 'checkout id is not unique' errors.
