### Do PF_LOCK_HANDLE / host_lock_handle functions actually do anything?

According to multiple Adobe engineers, PF_LOCK_HANDLE and host_lock_handle have been no-op dummy functions since AE CS6 (2011) when the codebase moved to 64-bit. Locking/unlocking handles is redundant in 64-bit address space. However, they still provide a safe way to dereference handles (effectively double pointers) and the SDK samples still call them. The DH macro can be used for direct dereferencing instead.
