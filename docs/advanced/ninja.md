### Are there CMake-based build systems for AE plugins?

Yes, there are several examples on GitHub: Vulkanator (https://github.com/Wunkolo/Vulkanator) uses CMake, and after_effects_cmake (https://github.com/mobile-bungalow/after_effects_cmake) is based on Vulkanator's setup. There's also a Rust-based project (https://github.com/virtualritz/after-effects) with its own PiPL compiler written in Rust. On Mac, you can use the Rez tool for .rsrc files and potentially use Ninja for faster incremental compilation.
