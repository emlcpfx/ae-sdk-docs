### How can I detect when the user performs undo or redo actions in my After Effects effect plugin so I can update my custom UI?

One effective approach is to save a random number or state identifier with your data, then poll the effect data (stored in a data parameter) once or twice per second to check if the state index differs from what your UI window expects. If there's a mismatch, the data has changed via undo/redo or project load. To optimize performance, you can save the random number to a separate parameter like a slider. When saving data, use StartUndoGroup() and EndUndoGroup() to bundle operations into a single undo entry. This technique works well for effects with custom external UIs that manage internal parameters in a structure, which is then serialized to an AEGP data parameter using AEGP_SetStreamValue().
