# Scope Guard

### What are best practices for error handling and memory safety in AE SDK plugins?

Recommendations: (1) Wrap AE handles in C++ RAII classes with proper destructors, use smart pointers. (2) Use scope guards (like the pattern from Dr. Dobb's) for cleanup on any exit path. (3) Use std::expected (C++23) or Result types to chain operations safely. (4) Implement an allocation manager that clears allocations when exiting entry functions, since AE handle pointers are not valid between calls. (5) In debug builds, add a cache validator to detect extra memory still allocated at function exit points. (6) Use custom breakpoint assertions that trigger breakpoints when debugger is attached instead of crashing.

### How does GLator (deprecated OpenGL sample) have memory leaks?

The GLator sample wraps GL rendering in try/catch. The suites.IterateFloatSuite1()->iterate call can throw PF_Interrupt_CANCEL in the download texture function, causing bufferH to never be deallocated. This leaks an entire output buffer of 32bpc pixels per frame from CPU, plus GPU FBO resources. Using scope guards (C++ RAII cleanup on scope exit) prevents this pattern - they handle cleanup regardless of how the scope is exited (exception, return, etc.).
