### How do you properly copy pixel data from OpenCV cv::Mat to AE PF_LayerDef?

Never manually allocate layerDef->data - AE owns that memory. Copy pixel data respecting rowbytes alignment. Use the sampleIntegral32 pattern to correctly index pixels. AE uses ARGB format while OpenCV uses BGRA, so channel swizzling is needed. When creating a cv::Mat pointing to AE layer data, pass layerDef->rowbytes as the step parameter. For performance, use memcpy per row (if same pixel format) and the IterateSuite for multi-threaded processing.

```cpp
PF_Pixel *sampleIntegral32(PF_EffectWorld &def, int x, int y) {
    return (PF_Pixel*)((char*)def.data +
        (y * def.rowbytes) +
        (x * sizeof(PF_Pixel)));
}

static void copyMatToLayer(cv::Mat mat, PF_LayerDef* layer) {
    for (int y = 0; y < layer->height; ++y) {
        for (int x = 0; x < layer->width; ++x) {
            cv::Vec4b pixel = mat.at<cv::Vec4b>(y, x);
            PF_Pixel& aePixel = *sampleIntegral32(*layer, x, y);
            aePixel.alpha = pixel[3];
            aePixel.red = pixel[2];
            aePixel.green = pixel[1];
            aePixel.blue = pixel[0];
        }
    }
}

// Create cv::Mat from AE layer with proper stride:
cv::Mat argb(height, width, CV_8UC4, pixelData, layerDef->rowbytes);
```

### How do you handle different color spaces when developing plugins for both After Effects and Premiere?

In After Effects, plugins typically work in ARGB colorspace. Premiere uses BGRA_8u with a special suite for 8-bit processing. For 32-bit float, you need to write your own conversion function. You can use the Iterate8Suite1 (or SuiteV2 since 2022) for ARGB, but Premiere requires a special BGRA suite. You don't have to support all color spaces—you can optimize for BGRA only and skip YUVA if needed. Basic rendering in 8/16 bit works without optimization, though you won't get the 32-bit icon next to the plugin. Check the SDK noise example for reference implementations of BGRA and YUVA colorspace handling.

### How do you handle colorspace differences between After Effects and Premiere Pro plugins?

After Effects uses ARGB colorspace while Premiere Pro uses BGRA_8u. For 8-bit BGRA, Premiere has a special suite available in the AE SDK (see the sdknoise example which demonstrates BGRA and YUVA colorspace support). For 32-bit float, you need to write your own conversion function. You can choose to support only specific colorspaces in global setup rather than all modes Premiere supports. Basic rendering in 8/16-bit works without optimization, though you won't get the 32-bit icon indicator.
