### How should I handle color spaces in Premiere plugins, and can I avoid dealing with multiple color modes?

You can use basic render in 8/16-bit without handling all color spaces -- it works but is not optimized, and you won't get the 32-bit icon next to the plugin. You can choose to support only BGRA and skip VUYA. In GlobalSetup, you select which colorspaces to support. However, 32-bit float is required for color grading workflows to access values outside the 0-1 range. The SDKNoise example in the AE SDK demonstrates both BGRA and VUYA colorspace handling for Premiere.
