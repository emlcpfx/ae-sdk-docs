# Cross Compile

> 1 Q&A · source: AE plugin dev community Discord

### Is there a way to create a universal .aex binary for both x64 and Windows ARM, similar to macOS universal binaries?

No, there is no universal binary format for Windows like macOS has. You need to compile separate binaries for each architecture. However, you can cross-compile for both x64 and ARM64 platforms on one system using the latest Visual Studio 2022 (after installing the respective tool sets). Note that AE on ARM is not EC (Emulation Compatible), so unlike Resolve and Nuke which run x64 code emulated on ARM, AE requires native ARM64 plugins. All third-party libraries you link to must also be available in ARM64 format.
