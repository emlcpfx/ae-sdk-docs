### How can I hide an effect parameter in After Effects SDK?

Set the AEGP_DynStreamFlag_HIDDEN flag during PF_Cmd_UPDATE_PARAMS_UI. It should get called when a project loads and the effect is shown for the first time. Note that PF_PUI_NO_ECW_UI in ui_flags only removes it from the effect window but not from the timeline. There is a known AE bug where duplicating an effect may cause the hidden parameter's owner-drawn portion to still appear in some cases.
