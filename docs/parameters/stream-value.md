### How can two different plugin types share arbitrary (ARB) parameter data?

AE blocks expression connections between ARB parameters of different effect types, assuming they can't be guaranteed to have the same structure. On the C side, use AEGP_GetNewStreamValue to read ARB values from other effects. To find the other effect, use AEGP_GetLayerEffectByIndex with an AEGP_LayerH. For consistent identification of a specific effect instance, store an ID in sequence data and access it via AEGP_EffectCallGeneric, or rename an invisible param (though that doesn't survive project reload).

### How can I programmatically set keyframes on effect parameters when the effect is first applied?

Don't set keyframes during GlobalSetup - there's no effect instance yet (effect_ref is garbage). Instead, try setting keyframes on the first call to UPDATE_PARAMS_UI. To set a value, first get the current stream value using AEGP_GetNewStreamValue, modify the value in the returned AEGP_StreamValue2 struct (e.g., valueP.val.one_d = 20), then use the keyframe suite to add keyframes. If the effect is added via script, it's simpler to set keyframes from the script instead.
