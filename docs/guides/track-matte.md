# Track Matte

> 2 Q&As · source: AE plugin dev community Discord

### What causes artifacts in 16/32-bit mode when a Track Matte is applied?

The root causes are typically: (1) Incorrect bit depth detection causing memory corruption - using wrong pixel sizes for memory operations. (2) Improper stride/rowbytes handling for padded buffers - when a track matte is applied, the layer gets cropped to a different size, changing the relationship between width and rowbytes. Fix bit depth detection to use rowbytes calculation and implement proper stride handling throughout your processing algorithm. The effect works in 8-bit because the rowbytes happen to align, but in 16/32-bit the padding differences cause corruption.

### Why does AEGP_GetLayerNumMasks return 0 even though the layer appears to have masks?

Track mattes and masks are two different things. A track matte is one layer operating with the alpha/luma of the layer above it. A mask is a vector shape drawn on a layer with the pen tool. If you're using a track matte, AEGP_GetLayerNumMasks correctly returns 0 because there are no actual masks on that layer. The mask suite only works with vector masks drawn with the pen tool, not track mattes.
