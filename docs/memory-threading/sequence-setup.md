# Sequence Setup

### How can I set a parameter value when an effect is first applied (during ParamSetup or SequenceSetup)?

ParamSetup is called once per session per effect type, not per instance, so you can't set instance-specific values there. SequenceSetup also lacks a specific instance association - the params array contains junk data and acquiring an AEGP_EffectRef will crash. The solution is to set a flag in new sequence data saying 'this is a brand new instance', then check that flag during idle_hook or UPDATE_PARAMS_UI and make changes accordingly. For unique instance IDs, use sequence data as each sequence setup call is triggered only once per instance when created.
