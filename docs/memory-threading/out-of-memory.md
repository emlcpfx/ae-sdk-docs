# Out Of Memory

> 1 Q&A · source: AE plugin dev community Discord

### What is the best practice when a plugin runs out of GPU memory during rendering?

Returning PF_Err_OUT_OF_MEMORY may cause AE to show a black frame without warning the user. Options: (1) Use a C++ text library to render 'Out of GPU memory' text directly onto the frame. (2) Set a static global boolean (protected by mutex) in the render thread, then display the warning in another thread like PF_UpdateParamUI. Avoid using out_data warning messages during renders as they would fail render queue operations and prevent MFR from retrying with fewer threads.
