# Sequence Flatten

> 2 Q&As · source: AE plugin dev community Discord

### After upgrading a plugin from CS5 SDK to the 2021 SDK with MFR support, AE crashes when saving the project. How to debug?

The crash is likely related to sequence data flattening. Check if PF_OutFlag_SEQUENCE_DATA_NEEDS_FLATTENING is set in global setup - if so, you must handle PF_Cmd_SEQUENCE_FLATTEN properly. When modifying sequence data, be careful about whether you're changing data in the same handle or allocating a new one. Debug steps: (1) Purge Xcode intermediates and clean rebuild. (2) Test SDK sample projects to verify they work. (3) Comment out parts of your plugin to isolate the issue. (4) Copy your code onto a fresh sample project.

### How can I detect when an AE project is saved, from a plugin?

There's no reliable pre-save notification. Two approaches: (1) Use command_hook to catch save events, but it's not 100% bulletproof (sometimes saves happen without triggering the hook). (2) Implement an idle_hook and check if the project dirty flag changes from dirty to clean - if so, the user has saved. For effect plugins specifically, use sequence data with PF_OutFlag_SEQUENCE_DATA_NEEDS_FLATTENING, which causes AE to call your effect with PF_Cmd_SEQUENCE_FLATTEN on save.
