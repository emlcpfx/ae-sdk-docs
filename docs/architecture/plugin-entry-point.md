### What is PF_REGISTER_EFFECT and will it replace PiPL?

AE's internal plugins now use two entry points: EffectMainExtra and PluginDataEntryFunction, defined via PF_REGISTER_EFFECT / PF_Register_effect_ext2. This appears in SDK samples like SDK_Invert_ProcAmp. While it seems like it could eventually replace PiPL, as of now PiPL is still required for AE - attempting to build without a PiPL/rsrc still results in AE not finding the effect. Premiere Pro no longer requires PiPL and uses this newer system. No official announcement about PiPL deprecation has been made.
