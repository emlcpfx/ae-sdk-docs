### How do you write cross-host plugin code that works for AE, Premiere, OFX, and other hosts?

Write host/format-independent processing code and create thin adapter/wrapper layers per host. This approach has been used successfully for AE/PPro/OFX/Nuke/Frei0r formats. The OFX SDK (partially based on AE SDK) is cleaner in some areas - for example, OFX supports thousands of plugins in a single binary (useful for suites like GMIC with ~2000 plugins), while AE requires separate PiPL/loader for each. When porting, the processing core stays the same and only the parameter declaration and pixel access patterns need per-host adaptation.
