### When is PF_Cmd_GLOBAL_SETUP called - during AE loading or when applying the effect?

In After Effects, GlobalSetup is called the first time the user applies the effect to a layer, not during the AE loading screen (during loading, AE only scans PiPLs). In Premiere Pro, GlobalSetup is called when the app is loading. You can show dialogs during GlobalSetup in AE since it happens after the app is fully loaded.
